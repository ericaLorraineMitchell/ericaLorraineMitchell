I am a Fullstack web developer student and an aspiring Technical Project Manager. My aim is to lead project executions that highlight intuitive and inclusive user experiences. 

I am passionate about technology inclusivity, accessibility and leaving my reach of the world a better place than I found it.

When I’m not leading and developing projects, I enjoy visiting natural landscapes with my Belgian Malinois, art museums, real estate, and honing my technical skills with ongoing short courses. I’m excited to utilize my cumulative experience to lead a fast-paced, quality-driven team that build better experiences with clients on the web. 

Contact me to chat about our next project!
