I am a Fullstack web developer student and an aspiring Technical Project Manager. My aim is to lead project executions that highlight intuitive and inclusive user experiences. 

I am passionate about technology inclusivity, accessibility and leaving my reach of the world a better place than I found it.

When I‚Äôm not leading and developing projects, I enjoy visiting natural landscapes with my Belgian Malinois, art museums, real estate, and honing my technical skills with ongoing  courses. 

I‚Äôm excited to utilize my cumulative knowledge and professional experience to lead a fast-paced, quality-driven development team.
